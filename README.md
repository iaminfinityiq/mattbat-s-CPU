This is a Python CPU simulation using mattbat's tutorial. You can use this to check if your CPU in Minecraft is working properly.
Change the settings in "program-settings.json" file, make sure the program file, the script.txt file and the program settings file are in the same directory.
- register-size is the size of the register in bits (means how large the number can be based on the number of bits)
- memory-size is the size of the memory in registers (means how many registers are in your CPU)
- instruction-size is the maximum amount of instructions that the CPU can perform, or the amount of instructions that you can write to your CPU for it to run.

Happy redstone :)
